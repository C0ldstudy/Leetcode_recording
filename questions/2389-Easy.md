### 2389. Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum
You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer array `queries` of length `m`.

Return an array `answer` of length `m` where `answer[i]` is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `queries[i]`.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Key idea
- sorting nums and queries to simplify the algorithm.
- check the boundary situation.


### Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def answerQueries(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        m = len(queries)
        nums = sorted(nums)
        sums = 0
        sum_nums = []
        queries_index = [i[0] for i in sorted(enumerate(queries), key=lambda x:x[1])]

        queries = sorted(queries)

        answer = [0 for _ in range(m)]
        cur_anw = 0
        for i, value in enumerate(nums):
            sums += value
            sum_nums.append(sums)
            print(cur_anw, m, sums)
            while cur_anw < m:
                if queries[cur_anw] < sums:
                    answer[queries_index[cur_anw]] = i
                    cur_anw += 1
                else:
                    break
        # print(answer)
        while cur_anw < m:
            if queries[cur_anw] >= sums:
                answer[queries_index[cur_anw]] = i+1
                cur_anw += 1
            else:
                break
        return answer
```
```python
class Solution:
    def answerQueries(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Sort 'nums'
        nums.sort()
        ans = []

        # For each query, collect numbers from lowest to highest.
        # If their sum exceeds the limit 'query', move on to the next query.
        for query in queries:
            count = 0
            for num in nums:
                if query >= num:
                    query -= num
                    count += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append(count)
        return ans
```
