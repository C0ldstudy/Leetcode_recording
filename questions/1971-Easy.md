### 1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph
There is a bi-directional graph with n vertices, where each vertex is labeled from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

You want to determine if there is a valid path that exists from vertex source to vertex destination.

Given edges and the integers n, source, and destination, return true if there is a valid path from source to destination, or false otherwise.

### Key idea
- Use a dictionary to save the neiborhood information.
- Use BFS to search and use a set to save the searched nodes.


### Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def validPath(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], source: int, destination: int) -> bool:
        if len(edges) == 0: return True
        neighborhood_list = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for e in edges:
            neighborhood_list[e[0]].append(e[1])
            neighborhood_list[e[1]].append(e[0])

        path = set([source])
        cur_pos = []
        point = [source]
        while not destination in cur_pos:
            cur_pos = []
            for p in point:
                cur_pos += neighborhood_list[p]
            for p in list(cur_pos):
                if p in path:
                    cur_pos.remove(p)
            point = list(cur_pos)
            if len(point) == 0:
                return False
            path.update(point)
            if destination in path:
                return True
```
