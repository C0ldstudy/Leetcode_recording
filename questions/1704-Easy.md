### Question 1704. Determine if String Halves Are Alike
Check the first half and the second half of a string are similar are not.
Simiarlity means they have the same number of vowels.

Solutions:
```python
class Solution:
    def halvesAreAlike(self, s: str) -> bool:
        keys = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
        former = []
        later = []
        length = int(len(s)/2)
        for i in range(length):
            if s[i] in keys:
                former.append(s[i])
            if s[length+i] in keys:
                later.append(s[length+i])
        if len(former) == len(later):
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
